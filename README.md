# Ecommerce-customer-segmentation
This Jupyter Notebook implements customer segmentation analysis using transactional data. The notebook likely includes:

Data loading and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and spending patterns.

Feature engineering to create metrics such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values.

Clustering methods (e.g., K-Means, hierarchical clustering) to group customers into distinct segments.

Visualization of customer segments for business insights.

This segmentation can help businesses identify high-value customers, tailor marketing campaigns, and improve customer retention strategies.
